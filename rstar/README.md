# rstar

A flexible, n-dimensional [r*-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree) implementation for the rust ecosystem.

# Features
 - A flexible r*-tree written in safe rust
 - Supports custom point types
 - Supports the insertion of user defined types
 - Supported operations:
   - Insertion
   - Rectangle queries
   - Nearest neighbor
   - Nearest neighbor iteration
   - Locate at point
   - Element removal
   - efficient bulk loading
 - Features geometric primitives that can readily be inserted into an r-tree:
   - Points (arrays with a constant size)
   - Lines
   - Rectangles
 - Small number of dependencies
 - Serde support with the `serde` feature
