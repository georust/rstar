/// An n-dimensional r-tree data structure.
///
/// # R-Trees
/// R-Trees are data structures containing multi-dimensional objects like points, rectangles
/// or polygons. They are optimized for retrieving the nearest neighbor at any point.
///
/// R-trees can efficiently find answers to queries like "Find the nearest point of a polygon",
/// "Find all police stations within a rectangle" or "Find the 10 nearest restaurants, sorted
/// by their distances". Compared to a naive implementation for these scenarios that runs
/// in `O(n)` for `n` inserted elements, r-trees reduce this time to `O(log(n))`.
///
/// However, creating an r-tree is time consuming
/// and runs in `O(n * log(n))`. Thus, r-trees are suited best if many queries and only few
/// insertions are made. `rstar` also supports [bulk loading](RTree::bulk_load),
/// which cuts down the constant factors when creating an r-tree significantly compared to
/// sequential insertions.
///
/// R-trees are also _dynamic_: points can be inserted and removed from an existing tree.
///
/// ## Partitioning heuristics
/// The inserted objects are internally partitioned into several boxes which should have small
/// overlap and volume. This is done heuristically. While the originally proposed heuristic focused
/// on fast insertion operations, the resulting r-trees were often suboptimally structured. Another
/// heuristic, called `R*-tree` (r-star-tree), was proposed to improve the tree structure at the cost of
/// longer insertion operations and is currently the crate's only implemented
/// [InsertionStrategy].
///
/// # Usage
/// The items inserted into an r-tree must implement the [RTreeObject]
/// trait. To support nearest neighbor queries, implement the [PointDistance]
/// trait. Some useful geometric primitives that implement the above traits can be found in the
/// [crate::primitives] module. Several primitives in the [`geo-types`](https://docs.rs/geo-types/) crate also
/// implement these traits.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```
/// use rstar::RTree;
///
/// let mut tree = RTree::new();
/// tree.insert([0.1, 0.0f32]);
/// tree.insert([0.2, 0.1]);
/// tree.insert([0.3, 0.0]);
///
/// assert_eq!(tree.nearest_neighbor(&[0.4, -0.1]), Some(&[0.3, 0.0]));
/// tree.remove(&[0.3, 0.0]);
/// assert_eq!(tree.nearest_neighbor(&[0.4, 0.3]), Some(&[0.2, 0.1]));
///
/// assert_eq!(tree.size(), 2);
/// // &RTree implements IntoIterator!
/// for point in &tree {
///     println!("Tree contains a point {:?}", point);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Supported point types
/// All types implementing the [Point] trait can be used as underlying point type.
/// By default, fixed size arrays can be used as points.
///
/// # Associating Data with Geometries
/// Users wishing to store associated data with geometries can use [crate::primitives::GeomWithData].
///
/// # Runtime and Performance
/// The runtime of query operations (e.g. `nearest neighbor` or `contains`) is usually
/// `O(log(n))`, where `n` refers to the number of elements contained in the r-tree.
/// A naive sequential algorithm would take `O(n)` time. However, r-trees incur higher
/// build up times: inserting an element into an r-tree costs `O(log(n))` time.
///
/// # Bulk loading
/// In many scenarios, insertion is only carried out once for many points. In this case,
/// [RTree::bulk_load] will be considerably faster. Its total run time
/// is still `O(nlog(n))`, i.e. `O(log(n))` per element inserted, but the scaling
/// factor is, on average, significantly improved compared with performing single
/// insertion n times in a row. **Note the performance caveat
/// related to the computation of the envelope**.
///
/// # Element distribution
/// The tree's performance heavily relies on the spatial distribution of its elements.
/// Best performance is achieved if:
///  * No element is inserted more than once
///  * The overlapping area of elements is as small as
///    possible.
///
/// For the edge case that all elements are overlapping (e.g, one and the same element
/// is contained `n` times), the performance of most operations usually degrades to `O(n)`.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// * `T`: The type of objects stored in the r-tree.
/// * `Params`: Compile time parameters that change the r-tree's internal layout. Refer to the
///   [RTreeParams] trait for more information.
///
/// # Defining methods generic over r-trees
/// If a library defines a method that should be generic over the r-tree type signature, make
/// sure to include both type parameters like this:
/// ```
/// # use rstar::{RTree,RTreeObject, RTreeParams};
/// pub fn generic_rtree_function<T, Params>(tree: &mut RTree<T, Params>)
/// where
///   T: RTreeObject,
///   Params: RTreeParams
/// {
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
/// Otherwise, any user of `generic_rtree_function` would be forced to use
/// a tree with default parameters.
///
/// # (De)Serialization
