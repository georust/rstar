///
/// type RestaurantLocation = PointWithData<&'static str, [f64; 2]>;
///
/// let mut restaurants = RTree::new();

/// restaurants.insert(RestaurantLocation::new("The Great Steak", [-0.8, 0.0]));
/// restaurants.insert(RestaurantLocation::new("Fishy Fortune", [0.2, -0.2]));
///
/// let my_location = [0.0, 0.0];
///
/// // Now find the closest restaurant!
/// let place = restaurants.nearest_neighbor(&my_location).unwrap();
/// println!("Let's go to {}", place.data);
