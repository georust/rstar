/// Advanced trait to iterate through an r-tree. Usually it should no be required to be implemented.
///
/// It is important to know some details about the inner structure of
/// r-trees to comprehend this trait. Any node in an r-tree is either a *leaf* (containing exactly one `T: RTreeObject`) or
/// a *parent* (containing multiple nodes).
/// The main benefit of r-trees lies in their ability to efficiently guide searches through
/// the tree. This is done by *pruning*: Knowing the envelopes of parent nodes
/// often allows to completely skip them and all contained children during a search instead having
/// to iterate through them, e.g. when searching for elements in a non-intersecting envelope.
/// This often reduces the expected time from `O(n)` to `O(log(n))`.
///
/// This trait can be used to define searches through the r-tree by defining if a node
/// should be further investigated ("unpacked") or pruned.
///
/// Usually, the various `locate_[...]` methods of [`RTree`](struct.RTree.html) should cover most
/// common searches. Otherwise, implementing `SelectionFunction` and using
/// [`locate_with_selection_function`](struct.RTree.html#method.locate_with_selection_function)
/// can be used to tailor a custom search.
