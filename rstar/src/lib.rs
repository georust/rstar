//! An n-dimensional r*-tree implementation.
//!
//! This crate implements a flexible, n-dimensional r-tree implementation with
//! the r* (r star) insertion strategy.
//!
//! # R-Tree
//! An r-tree is a data structure containing _spatial data_ and is optimized for
//! nearest neighbor search.
//! _Spatial data_ refers to an object that has the notion of a position and extent,
//! for example points, lines and rectangles in any dimension.
//!
//!
//! # Further documentation
//! The crate's main data structure and documentation is the [RTree] struct.
//!
//! Also, the pre-defined primitives like lines and rectangles contained in
//! the [primitives module](crate::primitives) may be of interest for a quick start.
//!
//! # (De)Serialization
//! Enable the `serde` feature for [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) support.
//!
//! # Mint compatibility with other crates
//! Enable the `mint` feature for
//! [`mint`](https://crates.io/crates/mint) support. See the
//! documentation on the [mint] module for an expample of an
//! integration with the
//! [`nalgebra`](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra) crate.
